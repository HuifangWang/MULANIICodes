% This README gives a brief introduction to the MULAN software.
% Full details can be found on the USer_Guide_MULAN2.pdf in the same folder
%  
1. Please in Matlab set path  which includes all MULAN subfolders.

Three demos you can start with:
2. Run: mln_Cal_seeg_Demo.m for applying MULAN to a SEEG dataset. The dataset is in ./Examples/SeegData/.
   Run: mln_Cal_seeg_Demo.ipynb  or just open mln_Cal_seeg_Demo.pdf to review all the codes.

3. Run: mln_opt_para_Demo.m for computation of optimal parameters.

4. For application on a human connectome based dataset using sub-networks:
   Run: mln_Cal_HCN84_Demo.m to obtain 15 sub-datasets with 28 nodes, then the basic methods and MULAN results by using two different optimal parameters for 2 different situations.
   Run: run ipython code: mln_plt_HCN84_Demo.ipynb or open mln_plt_HCN84_Demo.pdf file to review all the codes and results.

Also the bash files for cluster computation are found in the main folder.

Enjoy using MULAN to explore and analyse your data for connectivity results.
